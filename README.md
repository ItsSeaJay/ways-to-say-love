# Ways to Say LÖVE
A Public Disambiguation for the Eponymous Lua Game Framework

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Or was it `löve` or even `Love2D`? No matter what you call it,
[LÖVE](http://love2d.org/)
is an excellent way to make 2D video games with the Lua programming language.
Regardless of it's quality, none of it's users can seem to agree on how to bring
it up in conversation; especially through text. Much frustration occurs
when other community members type it differently to you.
Did they even stop to read your mind?

This repository aims to fix that, by giving you the means to **throw every
possible way of typing it at them at once.** Instead of using one method
and hoping that everyone else doesn't get confused,
just provide a link to this repository.
That way, the person - or people - on the other end will be in no position to correct you.
After all, it's not as if you can all stop worrying about it and get on with your lives...*
